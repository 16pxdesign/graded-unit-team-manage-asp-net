The project is to create new system called “Simply Rugby Management System” with the intention of facilitating trainers and other people managing the organization keeping updating records, personal data of members of this organization, detailed games played and training effects of each player. It is also designed to completely replace the current paper-based system. Currently only the administrator manages the data and in the initial iteration, only he will have access to the system after entering the password. The advantages of this application will be centralized system, much faster and more efficient storage, modification and viewing of data. All data will be stored in the database.
